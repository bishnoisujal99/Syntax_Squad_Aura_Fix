This allows the user to discuss their situation and assess the lawyer's expertise and suitability.\n\n5. **Understand the legal process:** The lawyer can explain the legal process, potential outcomes, and associated costs.\n\n6. **Seek a second opinion (optional):** If the user feels uncertain, they can seek a second opinion from another lawyer.\n\n\nI reiterate that I cannot offer legal advice or interpret the legal implications of any scenario.
